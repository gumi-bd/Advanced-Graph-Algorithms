# Advanced-Graph-Algorithms
A compilation of graph algorithms that require significant knowledge in the field

The following codes have been added so far:
 -  Push Relabel Algorithm (fastest expected runtime for a max flow algorithm)
 -  Edmond-Karp Algorithm (poly time complexity)


Verified using geeksforgeeks test.
 
Currently works for directed graphs, If you want to run for undirected graph, add reverse edge in main function
